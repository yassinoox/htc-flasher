**Can it be used in other new devices?**

Probably yes, all new devices using NBH format for rom upgrades should be supported out of the box, at least until HTC changes the SPL commands :)

**Can it be used in other old devices?**

Probably not, HTC Flasher v3 only supports devices using NBH ROM format, if your device uses older NBF files it is currently not supported.

Your feedback/patches are more than welcome :)
